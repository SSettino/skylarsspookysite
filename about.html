                <div class="grid-item"><p>My name is Skylar. I grew up in a comfortable family and got a decent education. I consider myself lucky to have won the birth lottery in such a manner. I am still unsure what my calling is, and I'm not happy that I still don't know.</p></div>
                <div class="grid-item"><p>I like fantastical costumes, but I don't dress up in them because of the exploitation and pollution of both humans and non-humans that results from the manufacturing and shipping process.</p></div>
                <div class="grid-item"><p>I am against animal cruelty in all its forms, and am vegan because of it. I implore everyone reading this to become vegan to reduce animal suffering, since animals are systematically exploited, tortured, and treated like objects by humans in an unspeakable manner which no other animals do.</p></div>
                <div class="grid-item"><p>There is some media that I really, really enjoy and consider all-time classics. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley is a literary example, but I also love the the gameplay of all the Legend of Zelda games I have played.</p></div>
